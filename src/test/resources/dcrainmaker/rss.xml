            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With friends in town for the past week, we’ve been a wee bit busy!  So I’ll call this the ‘things I did this past weekend…plus a little bit extra’ edition.  Let’s get to it!</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">1) A few fun rides around the city</span></h3>
<p>With our friends here, Phil and I did a few rides around the city.  Mostly 60-75m jaunts, somewhat scenic.  We did one night-ride, which was fun (and a rarity for me), as well as one early weekday morning ride.  While I almost daily ride the Velib (bike share) bike at night, it’s somewhat rare for me to get a workout in at night.</p>
<p>Here’s one shot from the <a href="www.dcrainmaker.com/2014/02/fly6-hd-camera-light.html">Fly6 camera/light unit</a> on the back of the bike he was riding:</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/image5.png" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="image"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" alt="image" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/image_thumb5.png" width="720" height="326" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It was actually the only camera we took on that ride, so, no other photos beyond those from the unit:</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/image6.png" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="image"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" alt="image" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/image_thumb6.png" width="720" height="362" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>No issues at all though there.</p>
<p>On both rides were were using Orp’s that I bought off of Kickstarter last summer, that came in a few weeks ago.  They’re combo front lights and bike bells.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/IMG_0424.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="IMG_0424"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="IMG_0424" alt="IMG_0424" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/IMG_0424_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>They work well within the city where ambient light isn’t a problem, and the light on the front is purely so other drivers can spot you.  But on our night ride we did a loop around Longchamp, which was unlit and in a giant park area, thus very little ambient light.</p>
<p>In that case, the light was not really enough for any at-speed cycling.  So we slowed down enough to not out-run our lights.</p>
<p>Still, for my primary use of using it in the city, it works just fine.  I love the bell!  Primarily because it sounds very similar to a Paris city bus, and thus virtually everyone responds to it (most people tend to respond to buses).</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140307_101820705_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="20140307_101820705_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140307_101820705_iOS" alt="20140307_101820705_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140307_101820705_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The unit charges via USB, and easily just quickly snaps onto any handlebar – even my tri bike bars (not the aero portion, but the base handlebar flat portion).</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">2) We went to Fontainebleau</span></h3>
<p>One of the Paris-area items we hadn’t yet done was visiting the famous chateau at Fontainebleau.  It’s about a 35 minute train ride from Gare du Lyon station, which is only a 5 minute cab ride or 5-7 minute bike ride from us.</p>
<p>Many people have recommended it being more impressive than Versailles, or other places in the Loire valley that we’ve visited, so we decided to give it a shot with our friends.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/DSC_1252.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="DSC_1252"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DSC_1252" alt="DSC_1252" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/DSC_1252_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Being winter, we lucked out in that there was nobody there.  So we basically had the place to ourselves.  No line, no crowds…perfect!</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140305_120122021_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="20140305_120122021_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140305_120122021_iOS" alt="20140305_120122021_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140305_120122021_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="271" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The inside of the chateau is well done, better than other places we’ve visited (though, not better than all).</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140305_123405093_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="20140305_123405093_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140305_123405093_iOS" alt="20140305_123405093_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140305_123405093_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And the outside gardens are quite nice and sprawling.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140305_133102653_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="20140305_133102653_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140305_133102653_iOS" alt="20140305_133102653_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140305_133102653_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/DSC_1255.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="DSC_1255"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DSC_1255" alt="DSC_1255" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/DSC_1255_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>However, I would call it a pretty far stretch to say it’s more impressive than Versailles (or some of the other places we’ve been to).  And, if I were a tourist in Paris for only a short amount of time, I’d probably skip it.  Given the Loire valley is only a 2hr rental car drive away (or train-ride, but it’s harder to get around the chateaux that way), I’d recommend folks go there instead.  Perhaps in summer it’s a much different place – but that’s just my two cents (actually, our 8 cents if you count the 4 of us).</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">3) Enjoying time as a tourist:</span></h3>
<p>In addition to going to Fontainebleau, we also did a bunch of other touristy things, some of which we’ve done before, and others we’d never done before.  While playing tourist might get repetitive to some, we really enjoy certain spots around the city – and are happy to go back to them a multitude of times.</p>
<p>For example, Sacré Cœur (with no lines to get in, or to the dome):</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140308_121631973_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="20140308_121631973_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140308_121631973_iOS" alt="20140308_121631973_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140308_121631973_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140308_124431401_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="20140308_124431401_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140308_124431401_iOS" alt="20140308_124431401_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140308_124431401_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And then cycling home past Moulin Rouge:</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140308_141159856_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="20140308_141159856_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140308_141159856_iOS" alt="20140308_141159856_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140308_141159856_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="720" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Where along the way I’d see a pedicab getting a ticket…from police cyclists:</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140308_142838370_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="20140308_142838370_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140308_142838370_iOS" alt="20140308_142838370_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140308_142838370_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="720" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And of course, there’s time at the Eiffel Tower:</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140304_213030000_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="20140304_213030000_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140304_213030000_iOS" alt="20140304_213030000_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140304_213030000_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="720" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Or, simply just riding Velib’s around the city late at night, approaching midnight I believe.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140304_220530330_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="20140304_220530330_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140304_220530330_iOS" alt="20140304_220530330_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140304_220530330_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="959" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>In this case, we were just about the only ones at the Louvre this night:</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/DSC_1236.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="DSC_1236"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DSC_1236" alt="DSC_1236" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/DSC_1236_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And then there’s the boat – Bateaux Mouche.  On a nice warm night (as it’s been lately), there’s few better places to watch the city fly by for exactly 60 minutes (usually down to the second).</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140307_195153808_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="20140307_195153808_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140307_195153808_iOS" alt="20140307_195153808_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140307_195153808_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, in the warmer months, the banks along the river are lined with even more people.  But for early March, it was a solid showing this past weekend!</p>
<p>Perhaps we&#8217;ll be able to convince our friends to come back in summer when things really get popping around Paris.  We certainly had a fun time with them on their trip this time (and it helps that they&#8217;re Ironman triathletes as well!).</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">4) My Long, Hilly Run:</span></h3>
<p>On Sunday Morning I headed out for my long run.  I didn’t actually have an exact route in mind.  I had wanted to run a majority of the way to the start/finish line of Sunday’s Paris-Nice stage, which was about 30 miles away.  The problem was finding the right route to get me there that would put me about 16-20 miles and near a train station.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I spent a lot of time on the interwebs but couldn’t quite get the route I wanted to make it work.  So instead, I just went out wandering.  As usual, started along the river.  It was packed out.  With the temperatures at about 70°F, it was by far the nicest day since last summer.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0280.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="VIRB0280"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB0280" alt="VIRB0280" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0280_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Instead of deviating from the river some 10KM later, I decided to stick along it for a bit further.  Ultimately, I’d take a turn off into a massive park area near/at St. Cloud.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0295.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="VIRB0295"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB0295" alt="VIRB0295" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0295_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><em>(For the record, that’s just the color above/below that the camera recorded.  I don’t quite remember it was that bright green, but it was very well watered…)</em></p>
<p>From there, I’d spend more time than I’d care to climbing through the park:</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB03051.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="VIRB0305"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB0305" alt="VIRB0305" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0305_thumb1.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0320.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0320_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Eventually putting me in the woods for many more miles.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0332.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0332_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>While I certainly wasn’t ‘lost’, as I knew roughly where I was, I wouldn’t say I knew precisely how to get to where I wanted to go.  I just sorted hoped it would work out.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0347.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0347_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It mostly did.  I’d end up arriving at Versailles some two hours later – about 16.4 miles.  The climbing really put a damper on things pace-wise.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB03651.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0365_thumb1.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>From there, I’d just take the train back home again, about 30-35 minutes.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">5) Lots of food was consumed:</span></h3>
<p>Over the course of the last 8 days that our friends were here, there was a lot of eating.  Daily baguettes and cheese was purchased and consumed.  And a lot of other breads from the various boulangerie’s that surround our home.  Like most who live in Paris, we obviously have preferences, in our case it depends a little bit on what we’re doing with the bread (i.e. sandwich vs cheese vs straight eating).</p>
<p>We were mostly putting to use newfound skills we learned in a wine and cheese tasting class we had:</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140304_111513436_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="20140304_111513436_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140304_111513436_iOS" alt="20140304_111513436_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140304_111513436_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>They taught us all sorts of things, but honestly, all I really remember at this point is eating lots of great meat and cheese.  After 5 glasses of wine, everything else gets a bit blurry.</p>
<p>There were also other meals that we went out and had at various restaurants that are either long-time favorites, or new ones we hadn’t been to – such as the one below.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140308_201449909_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="20140308_201449909_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140308_201449909_iOS" alt="20140308_201449909_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140308_201449909_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>While I’m not typically a fan of ‘foam’, in this rare case, it actually worked and provided some element of flavor.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140308_205430101_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="20140308_205430101_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140308_205430101_iOS" alt="20140308_205430101_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140308_205430101_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This <a  href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d2431710-Reviews-La_Veraison-Paris_Ile_de_France.html">particular place</a> is definitely one of our new favorites – not a single bad course.  Such as the chocolate ganache with salted caramel ice cream.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140308_213930827_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="20140308_213930827_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140308_213930827_iOS" alt="20140308_213930827_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140308_213930827_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>With that, I’ll save you other random food photos, in an attempt to not draw too much morning breakfast ire!</p>
<p>Instead, I give you a giant mixer!  We had to get another one at the CupCakery because our existing one simply wasn’t keeping up with demand any longer.  This new one has twice the capacity…yet somehow weighed WAAAAY more.  It’s unbelievable how heavy this thing is.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140307_114747430_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="20140307_114747430_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140307_114747430_iOS" alt="20140307_114747430_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140307_114747430_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, it even came in its own crate:</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140307_113901886_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28577" title="20140307_113901886_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140307_113901886_iOS" alt="20140307_113901886_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140307_113901886_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And it came just in time too on Friday!  This past weekend was the busiest it has ever been in the shop, with the spring only looking to get even busier as weekends are already filling up for numerous wedding cake and cupcake orders.  Good times!  Well, ‘good times’ as long as I don’t have to move another mixer.  Cause doubling it yet again would be a beast!</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Lots of stuff on the docket this week, including the Garmin Vivofit In-Depth Review and some other fun posts.  So thanks for reading!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Thursday I had a quick day trip up to <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff">Cardiff</a> for some work meetings.  Of course, it was somewhat a bit of a near-disaster in that I didn’t realize I was going to Cardiff until about 14 hours before I left.  Not because I didn’t know of the trip, but because I assumed said trip was to London.  As that was where I last had meetings with this group.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar (which would be 99.9999% of you), Cardiff is not London, nor, really anywhere near it.  It’s about 2.5-3hrs away by train from London.  Which would be sorta like going to Washington DC when you meant to go to Philly.</p>
<p>In any case, I found the singular flight a day from Paris to Cardiff (mid-afternoon, sigh), and flew up there.  It was a prop plane, with all of about 4 people on it.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140226_161931899_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28479" title="20140226_161931899_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140226_161931899_iOS" alt="20140226_161931899_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140226_161931899_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140226_162713288_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28479" title="20140226_162713288_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140226_162713288_iOS" alt="20140226_162713288_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140226_162713288_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Upon arrival I grabbed a rental car and pointed my phone GPS at the hotel.  About 5 minutes later, I found myself in a cow pasture.  Go Team Google Maps!</p>
<p>I backtracked to the airport and then simply followed road signs to the city centre, which was about 35 or so minutes away.  The unfortunate aspect being that I wasted much daylight in my cow-tipping excursion.</p>
<p>Thus, by time I got to the hotel, changed super-quickly and headed back out, here’s what the scene looked like.  A pretty scene, sure, but a bit low on the daylight factor.  Therefore you’ll have to excuse the non-pristine photos taken while running.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/DSC_1216.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28479" title="DSC_1216"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DSC_1216" alt="DSC_1216" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/DSC_1216_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>As always, I was testing some random device…or four.  In this case, the Garmin Vivofit was out on a run, comparing it to metrics from other units.  The Vivofit connects to your ANT+ heart rate strap, so I was looking to see the differences between the data captured on a traditional Garmin GPS, versus that on the Vivofit.  My heart rate is displayed below – 59bpm.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0277.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28479" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0277_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>After GPS signal was received by all devices taking part in today’s effort, I began my run.  For the initial portion I’d run alongside the <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_Castle">Cardiff castle walls</a>.  The castle was closed at this time of day, so I’d have to remain outside.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0281.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28479" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0281_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0288.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28479" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0288_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I’d run perhaps 1/3rd to 1/2 a mile along the walls before dipping into the massive Bute Park that surrounds the castle.  In the park were a number of running trails, as well as a river that ran through it.  All of which were mostly quite visible to the human eye, but a bit more fuzzy to the camera.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0305.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28479" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0305_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>At the end of the river trail, the path crosses a bridge to the other side of the river.  I figured I’d just make a loop out of it on the trails, but unfortunately the paved trail was closed that time of day.  So I had to take a small diversion through a non-paved trail to get back to a paved segment out along the street.</p>
<p>While it looks all Blair Witch, it’s actually fairly light beyond the brush, and there’s a number of people walking/cycling right behind me, and up to the right in front of me.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0324.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28479" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0324_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I completed my loop around the park just as I was finishing up my first 15 minute build section of the workout.  After that was done I’d be starting into a bunch of 800m repeats.</p>
<p>In this case, I selected a loop that went right by the main football stadium in Cardiff.  What was interesting was that I’ve actually been to this stadium – and thus by extension, have actually been to Cardiff before (a tidbit I’d forgotten about).</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0335.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28479" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0335_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>See, back in the 2012 Olympics they had a football (soccer) game here <a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2012/08/london-2012-olympics-odds-ends-and-fun.html">that we went out to watch</a>.  It was a bit of a mess to get to from London at the last minute, but, the game was enjoyable.  You can read all about the game in that post (and, if you’re bored this morning, you can read all my <a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/tag/london2012">2012 Olympic posts</a>).  You can also watch the short <a  href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNu8XDBSn10">YouTube video that explains that Wales</a> is technically a separate country from England.  It’s very confusing.</p>
<p>And ironically, I was just as confused about the placement of my rendezvous this time as I was last time I had something in Wales…that I thought was in London.</p>
<p>In any case…</p>
<p>I did loops.  At 2:54/800m, or about a 5:48/mile pace.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/image3.png" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28479" title="image"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" alt="image" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/image_thumb3.png" width="720" height="300" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It was relatively flat, so my paces were pretty stable each loop and while the effort was pressed, it wasn’t that bad at all.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0340.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28479" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0340_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>On the far side of the stadium (there was a river/canal in between that I’d cross bridges at, at either end), a TV camera crew was there doing spots for one of the BBC variants.  I think after the 3rd or 4th loop they started to wonder about me.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0344.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28479" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0344_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>A bit less than an hour later I wrapped up my fruit loops and headed on back to the hotel.  Along the way during my cool-down I managed to get one half-way functional photo of the castle entrance.  This portion was built in the 1400’s.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0359.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28479" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0359_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>As I walked the last couple minutes to the hotel, I stumbled across the street from the hotel, and got a photo of city hall.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0365.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28479" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0365_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, the most detailed and sharpest photo of the night would end up being the hotel photo.  Go figure.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0371.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28479" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0371_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>For those curious, here’s a bit of a map of the clusters of photos I took.  The hotel is down where it says 12/12/15, and the 12/9 is where the stadium is.  The cluster of 6/6/6 photos is the river turnaround.  The reason all the numbers are in multiples of three, is that the VIRB was set on burst mode, which takes three photos as a time.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/image4.png" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28479" title="image"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" alt="image" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/image_thumb4.png" width="720" height="460" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The next day after my meetings I’d fly back home to Paris.  Albeit I first had to drive some distance to a different airport – <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol">Bristol</a>.  Which, btw, is in a different country than Cardiff.  Nope, not confusing at all.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, I don’t know where the weeks go.  Before I knew it, I had flown to Wales and back for work, and it was already the weekend.  While I’ve still got to post my Wales Runaround from last week, here’s a look at our weekend!</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">1) Enjoying touristy Paris with friends from the states:</span></h3>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/photo.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="photo"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="photo" alt="photo" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/photo_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="720" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We had some good friends arrive on Saturday from the states, and since then we’ve been showing off the city.  Thankfully, the city has largely cooperated with great weather thus far, and even better weather planned for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>While overdoing the obligatory Tour Eiffel walk-through, I noticed this tree blossoming.  Given our highly warm weather this winter, I can definitely understand the flowering already – and definitely not complaining!</p>
<p>I’ll get more photos of our antics later this week.  Good times!</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">2) Watching a short bit of the Paris Half-Marathon</span></h3>
<p>This weekend was the annual Paris Half-Marathon.  <a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2013/03/paris-marathon-report.html">I ran it last year with The Girl</a>.  This year, the race was scheduled a bit earlier than I anticipated – the first weekend in March as opposed to mid-March.  So with completing the Barcelona Marathon just two weeks ago, it didn’t really fit the training schedule/blocks too well.</p>
<p>No worries, I just integrated a spectating tour of it into my long run on Sunday.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0283.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0283_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The race started around 10AM (*love* the late starts…), and by time it swung down to near our place it was about 45 minutes later.  We’re roughly the half-way point at the turnaround near Hotel de Ville.</p>
<p>I continued running upstream a bit on the sidewalk.  Below, along the canal leading to Bastille with one of the music acts beating away.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0294.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0294_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I’d actually cross the route twice on my long run round.  Of course, it’s fairly easy to cross, you simply run with the crowd for a short bit slowly working your way over.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0350.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0350_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>At this point in the race there’s enough separation that it’s easy to make the crossing seamlessly.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0348.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0348_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Congrats to all the runners (and numerous DCR readers) that ran yesterday.  And it was cool to hear a few of you (runners) shout out my name as you saw me along the course.  Quite surprising that anyone would notice me!</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">3) My Long Run</span></h3>
<p>As noted above, I had started my long run roughly a short bit after the half-marathon started.  I stayed along the river working my way opposite the runners, heading away from the center of town.  My goal was to run the other half of the perhipherique that I ran last weekend.  That’s the ring road around Paris.  <a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2014/02/random-things-from-past-weekend.html">Like last weekend</a>, I wasn’t technically running on the ring road, since that’s a gigantic highway.</p>
<p>Instead, I was running along the fairly new tram tracks that are just inside of the highway.  The path has bike/pedestrian lanes along the vast majority of it.  Oh, and as you can see – it was beautifully sunny and warm out – about 60°F.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0315.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0315_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>For the first few miles, the tracks were actually closed down, due to the half-marathon crossing it in two places.  Here, you can see the tracks headed into the runners just up ahead beyond the medics.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0322.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0322_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The best part about this route is that it’s un-screw-up-able.  You simply follow the tracks.  Forever.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0373.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0373_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It was cool though in that I’d never run up that way (north).  And I was somewhat surprised away by how nice it was along the tracks.  I guess I always assumed that area was a little less nice.  Below, crossing a canal that has more running paths and is also being re-done to make it even more walk/runner friendly.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0385.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0385_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Now, eventually the tram tracks do end for a short distance.  Thus it goes about 90% the way around the circle, but not this one stretch.  Which is sorta strange because there’s some old derelict tracks right next to where this ends, that ‘completes’ the circle.  Perhaps that’s next, since large portions of the route were just finished this past summer.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0405.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0405_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>After I left the loop, I headed inland back directly across the city, passing the Arch along the way.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0426.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0426_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Once I passed the Arch it was three miles to home, and also the last 20 minutes of my 2hr and 10min workout.  For this last section my schedule had me bumped up to race-pace.  Which is both easy and hard coming down the Champs-Élysées (below).  It’s easy in that it’s downhill.  It’s hard in that you’re dodging more people than you can shake a stick at.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0430.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0430_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>With about a mile or so left to go, I dipped into the tunnel that’s closed on Sundays for pedestrians and cyclists.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0445.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0445_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The tunnel is fairly long.  Perhaps 1/3rd to 1/2 a mile.  So perfect for testing out various internal pace systems in many of the new watches.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0453.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0453_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Once I popped out – blue skies and clear roads along the river for the remainder of the run home.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0460.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="VIRB Picture"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VIRB Picture" alt="VIRB Picture" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/VIRB0460_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>All in, 17.36mi on a hilly course in 2hrs 10mins at long-run pace.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/image1.png" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="image"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" alt="image" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/image_thumb1.png" width="720" height="350" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>A perfect day for a run!</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">4) Cycling to the market, grabbing ingredients for dinner</span></h3>
<p>Post run, I zipped right back out again on the bike share Velib bike to try and get to one of the markets in time to pickup ingredients for dinner.  I was sorta successful.  I had to tweak the planned menu a bit since a few of the stalls had already packed up by time I arrived.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140302_131042943_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="20140302_131042943_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140302_131042943_iOS" alt="20140302_131042943_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140302_131042943_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>So I grabbed some ingredients there and then biked a few miles away to another market that I knew was also close to closing, but figured I might luck out.  Below, the tops of celery, in case you were wondering.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140302_133219386_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="20140302_133219386_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140302_133219386_iOS" alt="20140302_133219386_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140302_133219386_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>When I arrived at the bike lanes next to the market – I was definitely too late (I went past the house, so I dropped off stuff there).  The stalls were torn down, and the lane cluttered with remnants of the market.  Within an hour it’ll be cleaned up and look pristine, but in the meantime, it looks more war-zone like.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140302_142147874_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="20140302_142147874_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140302_142147874_iOS" alt="20140302_142147874_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140302_142147874_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Which, is also how the streets looked 5 hours after the marathon, with water bottles everywhere near the water stops:</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140302_142432378_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="20140302_142432378_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140302_142432378_iOS" alt="20140302_142432378_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140302_142432378_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="540" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>They were slowly working their way down the course cleaning these up too.  But in the meantime, if anyone needed a spare plastic bottle or 10,000…you were golden.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140302_141922236_iOS.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="20140302_141922236_iOS"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20140302_141922236_iOS" alt="20140302_141922236_iOS" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/20140302_141922236_iOS_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>For dinner, The Girl took all the ingredients and whipped up some green apple and chorizo risotto, which used the carrots/celery/onions that I picked up, all minced.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/IMG_0352.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="IMG_0352"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="IMG_0352" alt="IMG_0352" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/IMG_0352_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Mmmm….so good!</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">5) Some movies were shot</span></h3>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/IMG_0276.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="IMG_0276"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="IMG_0276" alt="IMG_0276" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/IMG_0276_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Not a week goes by where a movie isn’t shot within view of our place.  The majority take place on the quay down below along the river.  Some take place on the street in front of our place.  In fact, one action movie recently hit the big screen with a chase scene that we saw being filmed right next door.</p>
<p>This weekend saw multiple productions – potentially related, potentially not.  There was some sort of car scene going down at one point where they blocked off our road for a short while, along with some big bangs/explosions.  Then, later at night they actually lit up Notre Dame.  Now that may sound normal, but in reality, it’s quite different.  Normally the church has much less powerful lights that shine upwards on it that are on daily till around 12AM-1AM.  Except this time, the above shot was lit by giant spotlights from across the river.  You can see them here:</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/IMG_0273.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="IMG_0273"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="IMG_0273" alt="IMG_0273" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/IMG_0273_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The next day, there was more activity on the bridge in front of the church, as well as below it.  Two separate shots.  There was a woman in a red dress hanging out with lots of cameras fawning over her.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/DSC_1229.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="DSC_1229"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DSC_1229" alt="DSC_1229" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/DSC_1229_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And then another crew that was likely waiting for the action to come.  They lacked said woman in red dress, and thus looked bored.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/DSC_1227.jpg" class="thickbox no_icon" rel="gallery-28437" title="DSC_1227"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DSC_1227" alt="DSC_1227" src="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/images/2014/03/DSC_1227_thumb.jpg" width="720" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We’ve seen everything from them making it snow on our block to cars going into the drink.  Always entertaining.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>With that – thanks for reading!  Enjoy the week ahead!</p>

<p>The Week in Review is a collection of both all the goodness I’ve written during the past week around the internet, as well as a small pile of links I found interesting – generally endurance sports related. I’ve often wondered what to do with all of the coolness that people write, and while I share a lot of it <a  href="http://twitter.com/dcrainmakerblog">on Twitter</a>, <a  href="http://www.facebook.com/dcrainmaker">Facebook</a>, and <a  href="https://plus.google.com/#114721129457730030996/posts">Google Plus</a>, this is a better forum for sending it on to y’all. Most times these different streams don’t overlap, so be on the lookout at all these places for good stuff!</p>
<p>So with that, let’s get into the action!</p>

<h3><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stuff that I found interesting around the interwebs:</span></span></h3>
<p>Here’s a not-so-small smattering of all the random things that I stumbled on while doing my civic duty to find the end of the Internet:</p>
<p>1) <a  href="http://deadspin.com/dominicas-fake-ski-team-scammed-the-olympics-and-the-p-1529973935"><strong>Unreal backstory on fake couple&#8217;s ski team in Olympics:</strong></a> Really interesting read – fairly detailed and well worth it.</p>
<p>2) <a  href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJkZgjrzJ40"><strong>Incredible helicopter avalanche control work video from Stevens Pass:</strong></a> This is one of the ski areas I grew up skiing at out in Seattle.  Definitely make it to about the half-way mark on the video when the charges go off and start taking out trees, unreal shots. (<em>via, </em><a  href="https://twitter.com/raykiro"><em>My Dad</em></a>)</p>

<p>4) <a  href="http://strobist.blogspot.fr/2014/02/a-guide-to-lighting-indoor-sports.html"><strong>Sports photographer?</strong></a><strong> </strong>This link talks through how to light indoor sports – interesting stuff.</p>
<p>5) <a  href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/02/25/google-motorola-2013-smartwatch-prototype"><strong>Pictures leak of the Motorola-made Google smartwatch that might have been:</strong></a> Interesting to see the Motoactv user interface elements in there.</p>
<p>6) <a  href="http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/jeff-gordon-really-wanted-show-his-stuff-pepsimaxs-test-drive-sequel-156002"><strong>Pretty entertaining Pepsi punked ad:</strong></a> This is spots-related in that it’s sorta car racing. Sorta. In any case, read the article for the backstory first, then watch the video.</p>
<p>7) <a  href="http://mashable.com/2013/11/05/biohacker-sensor/"><strong>Biohacker Implants Smartphone-Sized Sensor Into His Arm:</strong></a>  Umm…ok then.  I suppose that’s one way to get live-tracking on your runs.  <em>(via Paul N.)</em></p>

That’s about to change as the gas is being reported as the Next Big Thing in (possibly) legal performance enhancement. <em> (</em><a  href="https://twitter.com/tobycastle/status/438703479809638400"><em>Via Toby Castle</em></a><em>)</em></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Crowd Funded Projects of Athletic Note:</span></h3>
<p>Most of this content used to be found within the main section, but I figured I’d just call it out up here and make it easy to find. I regularly sift through Kickstarter and Indiegogo (plus a few others on occasion) looking for sports projects. Note that as always with crowd funded projects, <strong>assume the project will be late and will under-deliver on features</strong>. Thus far, on the numerous products I’ve helped ‘fund’ (except a leather bike handle), that’s been the case.  And finally, me simply mentioning them below is definitely not an endorsement, it’s just me mentioning they exist.</p>
<p><a  href="http://preorder.moov.cc/"><strong>Moov Activity/Cardio Tracker/Random Sensor:</strong></a> Lots of you asked about the Moov this week.  The unit acts as an activity tracker, but can also be attached to your bike crank and be a cadence sensor, or your running shoe and provide detail there as well.  It’s interesting stuff for sure. However, I’m generally skeptical of units that you can’t find hands-on time from any major media outlets (or any media outlets).  Further, I dislike that they’re running the crowd-funding on their own, rather than leveraging Kickstarter or similar.  The last company that did that – Earl – has basically been the poster child for how not to run a crowd funding campaign from an update standpoint.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sports Technology Software/Firmware Updates This Week:</span></h3>
<p>Each week I quickly highlight some of the new firmware, app, software and website service updates that I see go out. If you’re a sports technology company and release an update – shoot me a quick note (just one liners is perfect, or Tweet it at me is even better) and I’ll make mention of it here. If I don’t know about it, I won’t be able to post about it. Sound good?</p>
